#### What is the proper way to pronounce ktor?
{: #pronounce }

> kay-tor

#### Ktor imports are not being resolved. Imports are in red.
{: #ktor-artifact }

Ensure that you are including the ktor artifact. For example, with gradle and Netty engine would be:
```kotlin
dependencies {
    compile "io.ktor:ktor-server-netty:$ktor_version"
}
```
* For gradle, check: <http://ktor.io/quickstart/gradle.html#choose-your-engine-and-configure-it>
* For maven, check: <http://ktor.io/quickstart/maven.html>

#### Does ktor provide a way to catch ipc signals (e.g. SIGTERM or SIGINT) so server shutdown can be handled gracefully?
{: #sigterm }

If you are running a `DevelopmentEngine`, it will be handled automatically.

Otherwise you will have to [handle it manually](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor/blob/80f8c7bf352ac8075b8922b7f1aa94d7dc2ffdce/ktor-server/ktor-server-cio/src/io/ktor/server/cio/DevelopmentEngine.kt#L12).
You can use `Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook` JVM's facility.

#### How do I get the client IP behind a proxy?
{: #proxy-ip }

The property `call.request.origin` gives connection information about the original caller (the proxy)
if the proxy provides proper headers and the feature `XForwardedHeadersSupport` is installed.

#### My route is not being executed, how can I debug it?
{: #route-not-executing }

Ktor provides a tracing mechanism for the routing feature to help troubleshooting
routing decisions. Check the [Tracing the routing decisions](/features/routing.html#tracing) section in the Routing page.
